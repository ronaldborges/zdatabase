#NOTE
Oracle GoldenGate is a real-time change data capture application that provides guaranteed data capture, 
routing, transformation, and delivery across heterogeneous business systems. 
The application uses a lowoverhead architecture to capture transactions non-intrusively from a source database by reading online
transaction logs, transforming the data when needed, and applying those transactions with guaranteed integrity
to a target database in real time.1 Oracle GoldenGate’s processes run continuously—even bi-directionally—and
support high-volume, rapidly changing environments, moving tens of thousands of transactions per second with
very low impact. The target database is a fully functional database open in read/write mode and is a transactional
replica at a logical level, which can be leveraged for multiple applications, including a rolling database upgrade.
