+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#NOTE
AD Splicer registers off-cycle product as a valid Oracle Applications product for the given release
The splicing process enables AutoPatch and AD Administration to recognize the off-cycle product
AD Splicer uses control files to manage the splicing process
	– These are not related to the database control files
	
#AD SPLICER CONTROL FILES
Off-cycle products are generally released as patches. All product files and control files necessary to splice in the product are included in the patch.
There is one product configuration file, called newprods.txt. The product configuration file must be edited for your specific system before the off-cycle product can be properly spliced.

#NOTE
The product definition files must not be altered.
There are two product definition files per off-cycle product. They are
	* <prod>prod.txt: which contains language-independent information for product <prod>
	* <prod>terr.txt: which contains language-dependent information for product <prod> <prod> represents the product abbreviation for an Applications product. 
	  For example GL for General Ledger and PO for Purchasing.
The AD Splicer control files must copied from the patch to the APPL_TOP/admin directory.

#EDITING NEWPRODS.TXT

Each spliced product in newprods.txt has an entry such as the following:
	
	product=zsa
	base_product_top=*APPL_TOP*
	oracle_schema=zsa
	sizing_factor=100
	main_tspace=*Product_Name*D
	index_tspace=*Product_Name*X
	temp_tspace=*Temporary Tablespace*
	default_tspace=*Product_Name*D

#POST-SPLICE STEPS	

After the new product is spliced in, the files and objects for this product can be installed. To do this you need to:
	* Log out and log back in so that you are using the new environment file (or registry entries) to set up your environment
	* Verify that <PROD>_TOP environment variables are set for your newly-spliced product
	* Run AutoPatch to install files and database objects for your new product

2. Copy the following text files from 6280873/izu/admin to the admin directory under APPL_TOP.	
	izuprod.txt
	izuterr.txt
	newprods.txt
	
	[applmgr@appsdba ~]$ cd patches/6280873/izu/admin/
	[applmgr@appsdba admin]$ ls
	izuprod.txt		izuterr.txt		newsprod.txt
	[applmgr@appsdba admin]$ cp * $APPL_TOP/admin

3. Change directory to the admin directory under APPL_TOP.
Review newprods.txt and verify that the tablespaces listed exist
and are the ones planned for use by this product.
If changes are required, edit the file as appropriate and save it.

	cd $APPL_TOP/admin
	vi izuprod.txt

	product-izu
	base_product_top=*APPL_TOP*
	oracle_schema=izu
	sizing_factor=100
	main_tspace=APPS_TS_TX_DATA
	index_tspace=APPS_TS_TX_IDX
	temp_tspace=TEMP
	default_tspace=APPS_TS_TX_DATA

4. You must run "adsplice" from the admin directory under your APPL_TOP.
When you are asked to enter the name of your AD Splicer control file,
enter newprods.txt

	adsplice
	
	Filename [adsplice.log]
	
	The Default directory is [/u03/oracle/VIS/apps/apps_st/appl/admin] :

	Please enter the name of your AD Splice control file [newprods.txt] : 
	Product top directory for product "izu" exists.
	Directory is /u03/oracle/VIS/apps/apps_st/appl/izu/12.0.0

	Directory "log" for product "izu" exists.
	Directory "out" for product "izu" exists.
	Directory "mesg" for product "izu" exists.
	Directory "sql" for product "izu" exists.
		File "sql/IZUNLINS.sql" for product "izu" exists.
	Directory "admin/sql" for product "izu" exists.
		File "admin/sql/IZUNLADD.sql" for product "izu" exists.
	Directory "admin/driver" for product "izu" exists.
	
	Do you wish to regenerate your environment file [Yes] ?
	Checking if AutoConfig is enabled ...
	Running AutoConfig on : All products ...

	The log file is located at: 
		/u03/oracle/VIS/apps/apps_st/appl/admin/VIS/log/autoconfig_1.log
	
	Please check the log file for more details about the run of AutoConfig.
	
	AD Splicer is complete.

Errors and warning are listed in the log file
/u03/oracle/VIS/apps/apps_st/appl/admin/VIS/log/adsplice.log

and in other log files in the same directory.

5. AD Splicer will regenerate the environment file or registry. If you
have made manual modifications to your environment file or your registry,
you will need to apply those changes again.


	Verifying splicing of IZU
	--------------------------
	1. Log out and log back in so that you are using the new environment
	file (or registry entries ) to set up your environment
		exit
		su - applmgr
		[applmgr@appsdba ~]$ . ./APPLMGR_linux4.env
		[applmgr@appsdba ~]$
	2. Verify that IZU_TOP environment variable is set for your newly-spliced product IZU
		[applmgr@appsdba ~]$ echo $IZU_TOP
		/u03/oracle/VIS/apps/apps_st/appl/izu/12.0.0
	3. Verify that the product has been correctly created in the database by
	connection as "APPS" user.
		select fa.APPLICATION_ID, STATUS
		from fnd_application fa, fnd_product_installations fpi
		where fa.APPLICATION_ID=fpi.APPLICATION_ID
		and APPLICATION_SHORT_NAME = 'IZU' ;
	
	This statement should return one row:
		APPLICATION_ID 	S
		--------------- -
		278 		I
	4. Verify you can connect to the database as izu/izu using SQLPLUS.
		<SQL> 	select fa.APPLICATION_ID, STATUS
				from fnd_application fa, fnd_product_installations fpi
				where fa.APPLICATION_ID=fpi.APPLICATION_ID
				and APPLICATION_SHORT_NAME = 'IZU';
		  
		APPLICATION_ID S
		-------------- -
		278 	       I
				   
		<SQL>
