#NOTE
Air freight - Demo database description

We present you a demo database for PostgreSQL DBMS. In this document describes a data schema consisting of eight tables and several views. 
As subject area selected air transportation in Russia. 

The database can be used for example
• for independent study of the SQL query language,
• for the preparation of books, manuals and training courses on the SQL language,
• to demonstrate the capabilities of PostgreSQL in articles and notes.

When developing the demo database, we had several goals in mind:
• data schema should be simple enough to be understood without special explanations,
• at the same time, the data schema must be complex enough to allow building meaningful requests,
• the database should be filled with data resembling real ones, with which it will be interesting to work with.

The demo database is distributed under the PostgreSQL license.

Installation
There are three versions of the database available for download:
• demo_small.zip (21 MB) - flight data for one month (database size 265 MB)
https://mega.nz/file/UktBhQrC#JdhttwTb080PwQ5BrKnZyhajcDXiofCNYH5HY30cICY

• demo_medium.zip (62 MB) - flight data for three months (database size 666 MB)
https://mega.nz/file/Yk8RkACY#pg1BvWYiqEj9AXEhUqY4gqWLqqvYQgNZdy4xlNu-WJE

• demo_big.zip (232 MB) - flight data for the year (database size 2502 MB)
https://mega.nz/file/gsdmxZqI#ZrjwVvwj5EUS7e8GnSSaLneuHEG8Y-KHejCm8BuqlA8

A small database is suitable for writing queries, and it does not take up much space on disk. A large base will give you a feel for how requests behave on large
data volumes, and think about optimization. The files contain a SQL script that creates the "demo" database and fills it with data (in fact, this is a pg_dump backup). 
note that during installation, the existing database "demo" will be deleted and recreated! The database "demo" will be owned by the DBMS user who executed the script.

Description of the circuit The main entity is bookings. Several passengers can be included in one booking, each of whom a separate ticket (tickets) is issued. 
The ticket has a unique number and contains information about the passenger. As such, the passenger is not a separate entity. Like a name,
so the number of the passenger's document can change over time, so it is impossible uniquely find all tickets for one person; for simplicity, we can assume that all
the passengers are unique. A ticket includes one or more flights (ticket_flights). 
Multiple flights can included in the ticket in cases when there is no direct flight connecting the points departure and destination (flight with transfers), 
or when the ticket is taken "there and back". There is no hard constraint in the data schema, but it is assumed that all tickets are in one
bookings have the same set of flights. Each flight (flights) goes from one airport (airports) to another. 
Flights with one numbers have the same departure and destination points, but will differ in date departure. At check-in, 
the passenger is issued a boarding pass (boarding_passes), in which the seat on the plane is indicated. A passenger can check in only for the flight that
is on his ticket. The combination of flight and seat must be unique in order to prevent the issuance of two boarding passes per seat.
The number of seats (seats) in the aircraft and their distribution by service class depends from a model aircraft (aircrafts) performing a flight. 
It is assumed that each model the aircraft has only one cabin layout. The data schema does not control what places in boarding passes correspond to those available 
on the plane (such a check can be done using table triggers or in app)

Bookings.airports table
The airport is identified by a three-letter code (airport_code) and has its own name (airport_name).
There is no separate entity for the city, but the name (city) is indicated and can serve to identify the airports of one city. Latitude is also indicated
(longitude), longitude (latitude) and time zone (timezone).

Bookings.boarding_passes table
When checking in for a flight, which is possible one day before the scheduled departure date, the passenger is issued a boarding pass. 
It is identified in the same way as the flight - ticket number and flight number. Boarding passes are assigned sequential numbers (boarding_no) in order
check-in passengers for the flight (this number will be unique only within this flight). The boarding pass indicates the seat number (seat_no).

Bookings.bookings table
The passenger in advance (book_date, maximum one month before the flight) books a ticket for himself and, possibly a few other passengers. 
The booking is identified by a number (book_ref, a six-digit combination of letters and numbers).
The total_amount field stores the total cost of all flights included in the booking. passengers.

 Bookings.flights table
The natural key of the flights table consists of two fields - flight number (flight_no) and date departures (scheduled_departure). 
To make foreign keys to this table more compact, the surrogate key (flight_id) is used as the primary key.
The flight always connects two points - the airports of departure (departure_airport) and arrival (arrival_airport). 
There is no such thing as a “connecting flight”: if from one airport to another there is no direct flight, the ticket simply includes several necessary flights.
Each flight has a scheduled departure date and time (scheduled_departure) and arrival (scheduled_arrival). 
Real time of departure (actual_departure) and arrival (actual_arrival) may differ: usually not much, but sometimes for several hours if the flight is delayed.
The flight status (status) can take one of the following values:
• Scheduled The flight is available for booking. This happens one month before the scheduled departure date; before that, the flight record does not exist in the database.
• On Time The flight is available for check-in (one day before the scheduled departure date) and has not been delayed. 
• Delayed The flight is available for check-in (one day before the scheduled departure date), but delayed.
• Departed The plane has already taken off and is in the air.
• Arrived The plane arrived at its destination.
• Canceled Flight canceled.

The seats define the interior layout of each model. Each seat is identified by its own number (seat_no) and has an assigned service class (fare_conditions) - Economy,
Comfort or Business.

Bookings.tickets table
The ticket has a unique 13-digit number (ticket_no). The ticket contains the passenger ID (passenger_id) - the document number, 
identifying person - his last name and first name (passenger_name) and contact information (contact_date).
Neither passenger ID nor name are permanent (you can change your passport,
you can change your last name), so you can definitely find all tickets for the same passenger impossible.

 Materialized view bookings.routes
The flights table contains redundancy: information could be extracted from it about the route (flight number, airports of departure and destination), which does not depend
from specific flight dates. This information is what makes up the routes materialized view.

 Column                 | Type        | Description
----------------------- + ----------- + -----------------------------------
 flight_no              | char (6)    | Flight number

 days_of_week           | integer []  | Days of the week with flights
Now function
The demo database contains a temporary "slice" of the data - as if in some the moment the real system was backed up. For example, if some flight
has the Departed status, which means that at the time of backup the aircraft took off and was in the air. The slice position is stored in the bookings.now () function. 
It can be used in requests where the now () function would be used in ordinary life. In addition, the value of this function determines the version of the demo database.

Using Scheme bookings
All of the demo database objects are in the bookings schema. It means that when referring to objects, you either need to explicitly specify the schema name (for example:
bookings.flights), or first change the configuration parameter search_path (for example: SET search_path = bookings, public;). 
However, the bookings.now function needs to explicitly specify the schema anyway, so that distinguish it from the standard now function. 
10 request examples
To get a better understanding of the contents of the demo database, see on the results of a few simple queries.
The results below were obtained for the small database version (demo_small) dated October 13, 2016. If your system requests other data,
check the demo base version (bookings.now function). Minor deviations may be due to local time other than Moscow, and localization settings.

All flights are operated by several types of aircraft:

To understand where and where you can fly from, it is convenient to use the materialized the routes view, which aggregates information about all flights. For example,
where, on what days of the week and how long it takes to fly from Volgograd:

SELECT r.arrival_city as city,
  r.arrival_airport as airport_code,
  r.arrival_airport_name as airport_name,
  r.days_of_week,
  r.duration
FROM routes r
WHERE r.departure_city = 'Volgograd';

The database was formed at the point in time returned by the function bookings.now ():

SELECT bookings.now () as now;

With respect to this particular time point, all flights are divided into past and future:

SELECT status,

We will find the nearest flight departing from Yekaterinburg to Moscow. Use for this the flight table is not very convenient, 
since it does not contain information about the departure cities and arrival. So let's use the flights_v view:
\ x
SELECT f. *
FROM flights_v f
WHERE f.departure_city = 'Yekaterinburg'
AND f.arrival_city = 'Moscow'
AND f.scheduled_departure> bookings.now ()
ORDER BY f.scheduled_departure

Bookings 
Each booking can include multiple tickets, one for each passenger. The ticket, in turn, can include several flights. Full information about booking is in three tables: 
bookings, tickets and ticket_flights. We will find several reservations with the highest value:

Let's see what tickets the booking with code 521C53 consists of:

SELECT ticket_no,
 passenger_id,
 passenger_name
FROM tickets
WHERE book_ref = '521C53';

(2 lines)

If we are interested in what flights are included in Antonina Kuznetsova's ticket, then this can be find out by request:

SELECT to_char (f.scheduled_departure, 'DD.MM.YYYY') as when,
 f.departure_city || '(' || f.departure_airport || ')' as departure,

As you can see, the high cost of booking is due to the large number of flights. long distance business class.
Some of the flights in this ticket have dates earlier than the bookings.now () value: 
this means that they have already been completed. And the last flight is still ahead. 
After registering for the flight is issued a boarding pass indicating the seat on the plane. 
We can watch exactly what places Antonina occupied (note the outer left join with table boarding_passes):

SELECT to_char (f.scheduled_departure, 'DD.MM.YYYY') as when,
