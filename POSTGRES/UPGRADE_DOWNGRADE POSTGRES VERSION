If pg_upgrade fails after this point, you must re-initdb the
new cluster before continuing.

Performing Upgrade
------------------
Analyzing all rows in the new cluster                               ok
Freezing all rows on the new cluster                                ok
Deleting files from new pg_clog                                     ok
Copying old pg_clog to new server                                   ok
Setting next transaction ID and epoch for new cluster               ok
Deleting files from new pg_multixact/offsets                        ok
Setting oldest multixact ID on new cluster                          ok
Resetting WAL archives                                              ok
Setting frozenxid and minmxid counters in new cluster               ok
Restoring global objects in the new cluster                         ok
Restoring database schemas in the new cluster                       ok
Setting minmxid counter in new cluster                              ok
Adding ".old" suffix to old global/pg_control                       ok

If you want to start the old cluster, you will need to remove
the ".old" suffix from /dados-snap/data/global/pg_control.old.
Because "link" mode was used, the old cluster cannot be safely
started once the new cluster has been started.

Linking user relation files                                           ok
Setting next OID for new cluster                                      ok
Sync data directory to disk                                           ok
Creating script to analyze new cluster                                ok
Creating script to delete old cluster                                 ok

Upgrade Complete
----------------
Optimizer statistics are not transferred by pg_upgrade so,
once you start the new server, consider running:

./analyze_new_cluster.sh

Running this script will delete the old cluster's data files:

./delete_old_cluster.sh

#START DATABASE UPDATED
#REFRESH PARAMETER FILE /dados/data-new/postgres.conf with configuration parameters of the file /dados/data/postgres.conf
/usr/local/pgsql-9.6.14/bin/pg_ctl -D /dados/data-new start -l logstartnew

#RUN DATA ANALYZE IN NEW VERSION DATABASE
./analyze_new_cluster.sh
This script will generate minimal optimizer statistics rapidly
so your system is usable, and then gather statistics twice more
with increasing accuracy.  When it is done, your system will
have the default level of optimizer statistics.

If you have used ALTER TABLE to modify the statistics target for
any tables, you might want to remove them and restore them after
running this script because they will delay fast statistics generation.

If you would like default statistics as quickly as possible, cancel
this script and run:
    "/usr/local/pgsql-9.6.14/bin/vacuumdb" --all --analyze-only

vacuumdb: processing database "postgres": Generating minimal optimizer statistics (1 target)
vacuumdb: processing database "template1": Generating minimal optimizer statistics (1 target)
vacuumdb: processing database "postgres": Generating medium optimizer statistics (10 targets)
vacuumdb: processing database "template1": Generating medium optimizer statistics (10 targets)
vacuumdb: processing database "postgres": Generating default (full) optimizer statistics
vacuumdb: processing database "template1": Generating default (full) optimizer statistics

Done
